**Data Collection**: Begin by aggregating data from various sources. From web-scraping to
integrating with government reporting systems and other global data collection agencies.
Everything, don’t leave any table unturned. If there’s data to be gathered, we collect it. Build all
the necessary API integrations and in-house tools to gather data and throw it into giant data
warehouses on AWS (RedShift). Keep in mind, that data warehousing costs may be very high, so
starting with this process may incur long-term costs and a cost impact analysis must be done.
