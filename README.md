# Global Risks Index (GRIx)
### Guiding humanity's decision making through revolutionary metrics, models and frameworks.

## Tentative Components:
1. **Data Collection**: Begin by aggregating data from various sources. From web-scraping to
integrating with government reporting systems and other global data collection agencies.
Everything, don’t leave any table unturned. If there’s data to be gathered, we collect it. Build all
the necessary API integrations and in-house tools to gather data and throw it into giant data
warehouses on AWS (RedShift). Keep in mind, that data warehousing costs may be very high, so
starting with this process may incur long-term costs and a cost impact analysis must be done.
2. **Data Verification**: Building systems in place to check data accuracy by cross-referencing data
with multiple sources. A triple verification system to ensure the highest quality data. Garbage in
= Garbage out, so it’s very crucial to ensure maximum data cleanup at entry. Have data vetting
systems to rank data by confidence, anomaly detection, etc...
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze and summarize the main characteristics and traits of a
given dataset, and prepare it for ML training and analysis.
4. **Deep Learning**: Learn everything about the data, all the correlations and causation relationships.
5. **Establish Risk Benchmarks**: Utilize AI/ML to establish dynamic benchmarks to evaluate global
risk trends by connecting certain data points with risk events to determine what metrics tend to
light up when risk events occur.
6. **Interactive UI**: Build a GPT interactive UI to interact with the data.
7. **Visualize data**: Use data visualization tools to visualize the data, which could integrate with the
interactive UI to have an interactive data visualization tool (don’t believe it exists).
8. **Real-Time Data**: Utilize IoT, Bots, and real-time data collection methods to gather real-time data
and feed it into the model, to undergo a continuous updating and improvement process.
9. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Build a platform where stakeholders can integrate with this system,
give feedback, and use it as data input to their risk platforms while we build our other systems.
